# Capstone Project NufoChild for Machine Learning Path
This repository is used to store our notebooks for creating machine learning models and performing data pre-processing.

# What you need
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries: TensorFlow, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Selenium, zipfile, seaborn, albumentation
3. Webdriver: Chrome Driver

# Main Branch
Inside the main branch, there are notebooks for creating models, image scraping, and data augmentation.

# Documentation
1. To use the notebook for modeling, you can simply download or clone it and make sure to install the dependencies. Once you have done that, ensure that you have all the required data and enter the path folder where your data is stored.
2. To use the notebook for data augmentation, make sure you already have the data and enter the path folder where your data is stored.
3. To use the image scraper, make sure the path for the webdriver is correct and don't forget to replace the query in the code with the desired image.
4. To use the sorting notebook, make sure you have data for morning, afternoon, and evening, and for the recommendation notebook, ensure that the food data path is correct.
